# 🐍 Python Assignment 1: Custom Classes & Polymorphism

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains two Python programs that demonstrate the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including:

- **Class Design**
- **Constructors**
- **Inheritance**
- **Encapsulation & Polymorphism**

## 🚀 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class

### ✅ Description
In this part, we created a class called `Superhero` and a subclass `Supervillain`. Each class has unique attributes and methods, demonstrating constructor usage and inheritance.

### 🔧 Features
- Create a superhero with a name, power, and city
- Superhero can introduce themselves and fight crime
- Supervillain inherits from Superhero but overrides some behavior with an evil plan and a new method to fight the hero

### 🧪 Sample Output

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

### ✅ Description
This part includes a base class `Vehicle` and three derived classes: `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat`. Each subclass overrides the `move()` method to perform a different action.

### 🔁 Demonstrates
- Polymorphism by defining the same method differently across multiple classes.

### 🧪 Sample Output

| File Name               | Description                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `superhero.py`         | Contains the Superhero and Supervillain classes |
| `polymorphism.py`      | Contains Vehicle classes with polymorphic `move()` |

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Classes & Objects
- The `__init__` constructor
- Inheritance (`Supervillain` extends `Superhero`)
- Method overriding
- Polymorphism with a common interface (`move()`)
